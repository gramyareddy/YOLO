When compared to RCNN, FastRCNN,FasterRCNN , Yolo models are faster and could be used in real time object detection
However, the accuracy of the former models is higher than Yolo models

1.This repo shows you how to make a model  model from pretrained arch and weights.
2.Use it for infering Images
3.Use it in real time Videos
